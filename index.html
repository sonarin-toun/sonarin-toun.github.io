                            Vincent Van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 in Zundert in
                            the southern Netherlands. In 1869, he took his first job,
                            working in the Hague branch of an international art dealing firm.
                            He was not interested in the work and was dismissed in 1876. 
                            In 1880, at the age of 27, he decided to become an artist. 
                            He moved around,teaching himself to draw and paint and 
                            receiving financial support from his brother. 
                            In 1886, 
                            Van Gogh joined his brother in Paris, and met many artists. 
                            His style changed significantly under the influence 
                            of Impressionism, becoming lighter and brighter. 
                            He painted a large number of self-portraits in this period.

                        In 1888, Van Gogh moved to Provence .
                        He invited Paul Gauguin to join him but they soon
                        began to quarrel and one night, Van Gogh threatened 
                        Gauguin with a razor. Deeply remorseful he then cut off 
                        part of his own ear. This was the first serious sign of the mental 
                        health problems that were to afflict Van Gogh for the rest of his life.
                        He spent time in psychiatric hospitals and
                        swung between periods of inertia, depression and 
                        incredibly concentrated artistic activity. On 27 July 1890,
                        again suffering from depression, Van Gogh shot himself.
                        He died two days later.

                        Vincent van Gogh lived more than 115 years ago, and yet his 
                        artwork is still altering the way mankind views beauty, persona, 
                        individuality, and style in art.
                        His thousands of paintings and drawings have various 
                        characteristics that have been copied by thousands and 
                        duplicated by none. His unique life has inspired millions to become active in art.
                        Van Gogh's use of this new impressionist and 
                        post impressionist style altered not only his work,
                        but also all of art history.
